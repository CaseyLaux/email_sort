Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for SiemlessEmail
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed overview of the SiemlessEmail system. It will cover the overall description of the system and specific requirements that the system must fulfill.
1.2 Scope

The SiemlessEmail system is an email client designed to pull emails from multiple accounts and store them in one place. The system uses a fine-tuned GPT model to rate and classify the emails, which helps to organize and prioritize the emails for the user. The system is designed to automate the email sorting process and enhance the user's email management experience.
1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

    GPT: Generative Pretrained Transformer, an AI model used for text generation.
    IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol, an Internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail server.
    MongoDB: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective

The SiemlessEmail system is a standalone email client application that integrates with multiple email accounts via IMAP. The system utilizes MongoDB for data storage and GPT for email classification.
2.2 Product Features

    Email Retrieval: The system pulls emails from multiple email accounts.
    Email Classification: The system uses a GPT model to rate and classify the emails.
    Email Storage: The system stores emails in a MongoDB database.
    User-specific Collections: The system organizes data in MongoDB under user-specific collections.
    Email Prioritization: The system is presumed to organize and prioritize the emails based on the GPT model's classification.

3. Specific Requirements
3.1 External Interface Requirements

    The system must support IMAP for email retrieval from various email providers.
    The system must support connections to a MongoDB database for email storage and retrieval.
    The system must interact with a GPT model for email classification.

3.2 System Features

    The system shall retrieve emails from the user's email accounts using their email addresses and secrets (passwords or app-specific passwords).
    The system shall rate and classify emails using a fine-tuned GPT model.
    The system shall store the emails and their classifications in a MongoDB database.
    The system shall organize emails in the MongoDB database under user-specific collections.
    The system should be able to pull only new emails since the last time it was run.

3.3 Performance Requirements

    The system should handle multiple email accounts per user.
    The system should be able to handle a large volume of emails.

3.4 Design Constraints

    The system must comply with the email privacy and security requirements of the email providers it interfaces with. 




SiemlessEmail
This project is an email client that will pull emails from multiple addresses and store them in one client. During this import process there will be a fine tunned gpt model that rates and classifies.


The data flow for pulling the emails is as follows

|pullemails.py| >>emaildata>> >>accountdata>> |mongoDB[username][emails]| >>emaildata>> |gptapi| >>BS_emaildata>> |mongoDB[username][bot_sorted]|
