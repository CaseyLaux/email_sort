I was on the property the other day and noticed a handicap woman struggling to make it around the furniture to get towards the hair salon.  Please refer to section 71.D of your lease regarding the use of patio furniture and feel free to reach out with any questions.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nRebecca\r\n\r\nRebecca Mavros\r\nAssistant Property Manager at TSCG\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO (904) 746-0375 |  C (331) 202-7499\r\nW www.tscg.com<http://www.tscg.com>\r\n\r\nConfidentiality Note: The information contained in this email and document(s) attached are for the exclusive use of the addressee and may contain confidential, privileged and non-disclosable information.
