We know rising prices and supply chain disruptions have affected every business.  Our main ice machine supplier raised prices 3 times in 2022 for a cumulative increase of 16-21% - while inflation has ranged from 6.0 to 9.1%.\r\n\r\nLast year, we committed to not increase your price \\u2013 a promise we kept.  We also committed to reducing our costs in order to minimize this year\\u2019s price adjustment while maintaining the highest levels of service.  To that end, your monthly payment will increase by 5% - far below the ice machine and inflation increases shown above.  This increase will affect the equipment located at:\r\n\r\nGreen Turtle Kava - DAYTONA \r\n1500 Beville Rd\r\nSuite 103 \r\nDaytona Beach, FL 32114  \r\n\r\nThis new rate is fixed for a minimum of one year.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your business and will continue working tirelessly to earn your trust every day.\r\n\r\nJohn Mahlmeister\r\nChief Operating Officer\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact us at 866-327-9423 or customersupport@easyice.com\r\n\r\nhttps://go.easyice.com/e/840583/2023-03-31/tw78fy/541474474?h=l91TrZ95MJ1RpwVk0PMgJB2erYf5YeRyl0pg3HOYGAs\r\nCopyright ï¿½ 2023 Easy Ice, All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nOur mailing address is:\r\nEasy Ice\r\n925 W Washington St Ste 100\r\nMarquette, MI 49855-4061\r\n\r\nWant to change how you receive these emails?
