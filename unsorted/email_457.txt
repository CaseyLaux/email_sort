There can be penalties for not having these posters which can total up to $7,000. Since these posters can update several times a year with the changing laws, let ADP take this task off your hands with our Labor Law Poster Compliance service.\r\n\r\nYou can simply reply to this email or reach me out to my direct line 412-274-8985. We can provide you with more information.\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\nhttp://images.adpinfo.com/images/tinydot.gif\r\n\r\nRocco Flocco  | District Manager\r\n\r\nPhone: 4122748985\r\n\r\nEmail: rocco.flocco@adp.com <mailto:rocco.flocco@adp.com>\r\n\r\n\"ADP Logo\" <https://www.adp.com/?cid=elq_sales_enablement_&campaignid=&ecid=31434441&utm_source=eloqua&utm_medium=email&elqTrackId=d66e7bb7ba7f44b484adc8f86ac609c9&elq=04ca05d39cbc4265ab8e9e0f0b59b1cf&elqaid=182307&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=>                         \r\n\r\nADP, the ADP logo, and Always Designing for People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.
