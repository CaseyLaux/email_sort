Employee handbooks create a contract with the employees of what is expected of them and educates them on what they can expect from you.                              \r\n\r\nIdeally, it is created at the start of your business and updated yearly to keep up with current industry and state guidelines. We will help you get this done NOW!                                                          \r\n\r\nThrough ADP’s HR platforms we will help you to create or update your employee handbook to include things such as a welcome message to new or current employees as well as what policies and procedures you’ll choose to have in place to fit your specific business needs such as:                                                                                           *Sexual Harassment\r\n*Behavior Policies\r\n*Attendance\r\n*Meal and Rest Periods\r\n*Timekeeping\r\n*Telephone/E-mail/Internet Use\r\n*Social Media\r\n*Benefits\r\n*And more…\r\n\r\nUltimately, this helps defend your business against employee claims and employee acknowledgement will create a more productive environment allowing your small business to run more smoothly!                                                          \r\n\r\nPlease reply YES to this email, if you’re interested in getting ADP’s help in setting up an employee handbook or with any other HR matters!                             \r\n\r\nThanks!                             \r\n\r\nhttp://images.adpinfo.com/images/tinydot.gif\r\n\r\nNick Herman  | Intern\r\n\r\nPhone: 16104926537\r\n\r\nEmail: nick.herman@adp.com <mailto:nick.herman@adp.com>\r\n\r\nADP, the ADP logo, and Always Designing for People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.
